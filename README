git-at
======

somehow i didn't know that you can do

```
git show <commit-ish>:<filepath>
```

to view a file at a specific point in history, until [1].

git-at is just a very simple wrapper script that will
cat the file, place the contents into
/tmp/git-at/<repo_name>/<rel_path_to_file>,
will remove the write permission
and will open it with your $EDITOR.

note it's not POSIX-compliant. PRs welcome.

though, if you're looking for intro videos on how git works
internally, [2] might be a better start, and [3] afterwards,
and then [1] - at least that was my order of going thru them.
